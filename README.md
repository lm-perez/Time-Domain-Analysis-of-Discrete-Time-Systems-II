# Time-Domain-Analysis-of-Discrete-Time-Systems-II
In this lab, the concept of discrete time-signals was explored. In Part A, the unit impulse response for various systems were found using MATLAB and were verified through manual calculations. With the acquired unit impulse responses, they were compared to see if both methods were correct. For Part B, a system was given and its initial conditions were found. Using the conditions, the zero input response was plotted. For Part C, the given input was used to find the zero-state response of the system in Part B. In part D, the total response of the system in part B to the input from Part C was plotted. It was then examined if the total response can be found by adding the zero-input response from Part B and from Part C, which was determined to be true. In Part E, by using convolution of the input signal and the unit impulse response, the zero state impulse was computed by using the acquired information from Part B and C.  In Part F, a filter is designed to calculate the average points from a signal. The filter is displayed through various points while simultaneously comparing the output signal to the input signal.
